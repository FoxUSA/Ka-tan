## FAQ

### I need a chat. Why don't you build one?
Facetime, Hangouts, Skype, Duo, Allo ....

### Why did you not implement cards

`Cards are normally secret. It was hard to come up with a way to work that into a screen everyone looks at. MVP didn't need it. Multiple banks works well. This is open source so implement it yourself if it bugs you.`

### Is this against copyright law because of bla bla bla

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯ who knows. `
[Colonizers](https://github.com/colonizers/colonizers) another opensouce project has existed for awhile and hasn't been hunted down and had all their resource cards taken away.
